                h2 Easily Create Modern Web Layouts

                p.
                    The Plone 6 user experience has been redesigned from scratch to be awesome for power users and occasional users alike. It's easy to create adaptive layouts using a flexible and powerful blocks system built from the latest web technologies. There's no need for in-depth knowledge of how the web works or how the page will look on thousands of different devices - editors can split individual blocks into multi-column content that will automatically adapt to any device. Building complex, responsive pages with Plone 6 is effortless.

The blocks system is not limited to rich text. It will come with a faceted search block that allows editors to easily create sophisticated searches that make use of content metadata. Other blocks can present collections of content dynamically generated from a search. Plone has always included search, now the blocks system allows the search to be harnessed in new ways.
